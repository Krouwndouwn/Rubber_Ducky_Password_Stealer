# Rubber Ducky Password Stealer

With this software it is possible to retrieve user passwords from a Windows 10/11 system. For example, passwords from browsers, installed programs and system saved passwords such as WiFi passwords. In addition, there is also an optional option to add scripts that retrieve system information, program information, network information, etc. It is also possible to add your own .bat scripts that are automatically executed next to the current scripts.

The above data is stored in text files on the SD card of the Rubber Ducky. This data is stored in a folder with the target's computer and username so that there are no complications when running on multiple computers or user accounts.

The Twin Duck firmware, custom payload, custom scripts and third party programs made it possible to achieve this. Thanks to the external parties mentioned on this GitHub page who are an important part of this functionality.

The purpose of this software is to recover forgotten passwords, improve your own digital security and gain knowledge about a Rubber Ducky, the Twin Duck firmware, writing scripts in combination with the use of external programs etc. It is not intended to be used for malicious purposes.
